  <h1>space </h1>  
  <p>this is my page about space Asteroids. Asteroids are rocky, airless worlds that orbit our Sun. ...
    Comets.
    Meteoroids. Meteoroids are fragments and debris in space resulting from collisions among asteroids, comets, moons, and planets. ...
    There is no air or atmosphere in space. Since it is a vacuum, sound waves will have no medium to travel to. That means, no one will hear you scream in space, even if you shout the loudest!

While sound waves (mechanical waves) need a medium to travel, radio waves (electromagnetic waves) can travel in the void of space. Astronauts use radios to stay in communication while in space since radio waves can still be sent and received in a vacuum environment.
The sheer size of space makes it impossible to accurately predict just how many stars we have. Right now, scientists and astronomers use the number of stars only within our galaxy, the Milky Way, to estimate.

That number is between 200-400 billion stars and there are estimated to be billions of galaxies so the stars in space really are completely uncountable.
